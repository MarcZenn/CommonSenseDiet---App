		<p class="about-copy">
			We've all heard of the Atkins diet and the Paleo diet and the raw foods diet and the blood type diet and
			the cigarette diet and the baby food diet and the WWII rations diet and the don't eat anything diet but come on! Hasn't it all gotten just a bit too riduculous? Since when did eating healthy become so complicated? What in the world happend to common sense?
		</p>
		<p class="about-copy">
			We believe you don't need a guru or fad
			to know if a certain food is good for your body. This website is meant to help you know if a certain
			food, dish, beverage or meal is healthy for you with a simple yes, no or maybe
			response. Simply search any food, beverage or meal and get a YES, NO or MAYBE response... That's it!
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p class="about-copy">
			What do we actually know about nutrition?... Uh nothing! We simply BELIEVE that eating healthy is simple. Is a cheeseburger good for you? NO! Is an apple good for you? YES!<br/>
		</p>
		<p class="about-copy">
			See how easy that was! Some might call it common sense...but then again
			common sense isn't so common is it? Why follow some crazy, out-of-the-box
			diet fad that you can't stick to anyways? Before you eat something, just Goodle it?
