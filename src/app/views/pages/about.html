		<p class="about-copy">
			We've all heard of the Atkins diet and the Paleo diet and the raw foods diet and the blood type diet and
			the cigarette diet and the don't eat diet but hasn't it all gotten just a tad too riduculous?
		</p>
		<p class="about-copy">
			Since when did eating well become so complicated? We believe you don't need a manuscript or manual
			to know if a certain food item is healthy to eat or not. This website is meant to help you know if a certain
			food or dish is healthy for you, or not healthy for you, with a simple yes, no or maybe
			response...thats it. Simply search any foods/meals and get a YES, NO or MAYBE. That's it.
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p class="about-copy">
			What do we actually know about nutrition?...Nothing! We simply BELIEVE that eating right isn't
			that complicated. Is a cheeseburger good for you?..NO. Is an apple good for you? YES.<br/>
		</p>
		<p class="about-copy">
			See how easy that was! Some might call this common sense...but then again
			common sense isn't so common is it? Why follow some crazy, out-of-the-box
			diet fad that you can't stick to anyways? Before you eat that just ask,
			Is this good for me?
