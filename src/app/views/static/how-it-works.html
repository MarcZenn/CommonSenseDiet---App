      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Every searchable food and beverage in our database, aka the <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/">USDA Food Composition Databases</a>, once searched, is assigned a <span class="highlight">Health Score</span>. The maximum Health Score for any food is 100 points. Every food starts off with 75 Health Score points before encountering our algorithm, humbly named, the <span class="highlight">Optimal Nutrition Assurance Algorithm</span>, or <span class="highlight">ONAA</span> for short. Ultimately, it is ONAA's job to give each food and/or beverage a final Health Score which is then used to determine the final answer. A Health Score of 100 points indicates the healthiest possible food you could eat while a Health Score of 1 point represents the worst possible food you could eat. Such is the importance of the soon-to-be legendary <span class="highlight">Health Score</span>.
