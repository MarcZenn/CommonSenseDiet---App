      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Much like your everyday onion, <a href="http://www.jonnybowden.com/onions-a-real-superfood/">which is super healthy for you and widely regarded as a super food!</a>, our <span class="highlight">Optimal Nutrition Assurance Algorithm (ONAA),</span> has layers. She's complicated. But don't worry. It helps to think of each "layer" as one of ONAA's primary functions. There are in fact 4 primary layers and 2 secondary layers. Each one of the primary layers will deal with either the nutrients, calories, sugars, or fat content per food and represents 25 total Health Score points. We'll walk you through every one of ONAA's layers and discover the role each one plays in helping to evaluate a given food as something you should eat...or not eat.
  		</p>
    </div>

    <div class="how-it-works-section">
      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 1:</span> You Are What Your Food Is:</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        ONAA's first layer, one of its 4 primary functions, is considered to be one of the most informative layers in terms of evaluating harmful nutrients for a given food. As such, this layer affects the overall Health Score greatly and accounts for 25 of the maximum 100 Health Score points a food can receive (or 1/4th of the total points avaiable). To be more precise, ONAA's goal here is to identify 25 of the most harmful and unhealthy nutrients, ingredients, minerals, vitamins, acids, additives, substances, proteins, GMO's etc. per food and adjust that food's Health Score accordingly.
				To do this it relies on our <span class="highlight">Optimal Nutrition Index</span>, or <span class="highlight">ONI</span> for short, which you can read more about <a href="#">here</a>. So why does ONAA need to rely on ONI to adjust a food's Health Score?
  		</p>
			<br />
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Basically you can think of ONI as a list of the 25 most harmful substances a food could have. For every item in ONI's <span class="highlight">Unhealthy Index</span> list that is also found in a food's nutritional data, a point is subtracted from that food's overall Health Score. Since ONI's unhealthy index list has only 25 substances in it, a food could only lose a maximum of 25 points in this stage. If a food did in fact lose 25 points in this layer it would start off with a Health Score of 75, which is ok but not great. Especially considering that there are 4 more layers to pass through.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="how-it-works-section">
      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 2:</span> Watch Those Calories Baby:</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Next we have to consider the amount of calories (measured in kcals) for every 100 grams of a given food. 100 grams is what ONAA deems as <span class="highlight">one serving</span>, which is equal to roughly a half pound, of any given food. If we take the daily recommended calorie intake for most people worldwide across all ages, <span class="highlight">2500 kcals</span><a href="https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/usda_food_patterns/EstimatedCalorieNeedsPerDayTable.pdf">*</a>, and our food's total kcals per serving, ONAA can use these two data points to tell how many servings of that food you can eat before reaching the daily recommended calorie limit and conditionally remove anywhere between 1 to 25 points to the overall Health Score of a given food. The whole idea here is that the more of something you can eat without exceeding your recommended calorie intake, the healthier it is for you! So how does ONAA actually calculate the number of points to assign?
  		</p>
			<br />
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Because there are a maximum of 25 points to assign here, we can divide the daily recommended calorie intake by 25 and see that every 1/100th of that limit is now worth a point. Or in other words, if a food has 100 kcals or less, (1/25th of 2500 kcals), per serving then it will only lose 1 point. If a food has 250 kcals then ONAA will subtract 3 points and the closer kcals/serving gets to 2500 kcals the more points ONAA will subtract.

      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 3:</span> Remember Jump Rope for Heart?:</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        According to the American Heart Association:
        <span class="highlight">"You should limit the amount of trans-fats to less than 1 percent of your total daily calories. That means if you need about 2,000 calories a day, less than 20 calories (or 2 grams) should come from trans fats"</span>. For our purposes ONAA will use 2500 calories a day which means the maximum recommended limit for trans-fats is 2.5 grams a day. Considering that there are a total of 25 points at stake here, this works out rather well for us! How so?
  		</p>
			<br />
			<p class="how-it-works-copy">
				If we divide our daily trans-fat limit by the number of points for this layer, we can attribute every .1 of a trans-fat gram as one whole point. Thus for every .1 grams of trans-fat in a serving for a given food, ONAA will deduct 1 whole point from that food's overall Health Score but before it does so, it will multiply the number of points deducted by a factor of 2. In other words for every 1 point ONAA deducts, it's actually deducting two points....confused?
			</p>
			<br />
			<p class="how-it-works-copy">
				The reason for this 2x factor deduction is because trans-fats are really, really, really bad for you. As the Mayo clinic puts it, <span class="highlight">"Trans fat is considered by many doctors to be the worst type of fat you can eat. Unlike other dietary fats, trans fat — also called trans-fatty acids — both raises your LDL ("bad") cholesterol and lowers your HDL ("good") cholesterol."</span>. Which basically means even the most minute amount of trans-fat should be avoided.

      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 4:</span> Yes, Sugar Love is in Your DNA:</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        In the 2015, the <span class="highlight">World Health Organization,</span> cut the recommended sugar intake for adults in half from the original 10 percent of total daily calories to five percent. For a normal weight adult, that's about 25 grams, or 6 teaspoons, per day. This is because when it comes to sugar, one could make the case that it's just as bad for you as trans-fats regardless of wether you're talking about Fructose or Sucrose<a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/is-sugar-really-bad-for-you-it-depends/">*</a>. Thus, as far as we're concerned, sugar intake must be highly limited especially when you consider that only half a can of soda would put most men and women past their daily recommended sugar limit.
  		</p>
			<p class="how-it-works-copy">
				In this layer, ONAA's final primary function, For every 1 gram of total sugar in a given food, ONAA will subtract 1 point, multiplied by a factor of 2x, from that food's overall Health Score.

      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 5:</span> ONNA's Hierarchy of Food Needs:</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Remember that silly food group pyramid we used to study in elementary school? Well as it turns out, it's not as useless as we all thought! ONNA's fifth layer is regarded as one of it's least informative functions in terms of evaluating how healthy a given food is to consume. As such, this layer affects the overall Health Score very little and accounts for only 5 bonus points on top of the maximum 100 Health Score points a food can receive. Currently the United States Department of Agriculture recognizes 25 distinct food groups. While most of these food groups don't really indicate how healthy any of the foods that fall under it are, there are a few groups that we can confidently identify as mostly unhealthy. Those groups, as recognized by the United States Department of Agriculture, are the "Fast Foods" group and "Sweets" group.
  		</p>
			<p class="how-it-works-copy">
      	Because of this, if ONNA finds that a given food is categorized as "Fast Foods" or "Sweets", it will automatically subtract 5 points from that food's final Health Score.
