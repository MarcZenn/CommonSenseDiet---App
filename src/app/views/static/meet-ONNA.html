        Much like your everyday onion, <a href="http://www.jonnybowden.com/onions-a-real-superfood/">(which is super healthy for you and widely regarded as a super food!)</a>, ONAA has layers. She's complicated. But don't worry. It helps to think of each "layer" as one of ONAA's primary functions. We'll walk you through every one of ONAA's layers and discover the role each one plays in helping to evaluate a given food as something you should eat or NOT eat. Each one of ONAA's primary functions affects a food's final Health Score and there are 5 "layers" in all. Ultimately, it is ONAA's job to give each food/beverage a final <span class="highlight">Health Score</span> which is then used to determine if you should eat it.

      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 1:</span> You Are What Your Food Is:</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        ONAA's outer layer, it's first primary function, is considered to be the most informative layer in terms of evaluating how healthy a given food is to consume. As such, this layer affects the overall Health Score the greatest and accounts for 30 of the maximum 100 Health Score points a food can receive. ONAA's goal here is to identify any harmful and/or highly unhealthy nutrients, ingredients, minerals, vitamins, acids, additives, substances, proteins, GMO's etc. per food and adjust that food's Health Score accordingly. To do this it relies on our <span class="highlight">Optimal Nutrition Index</span>, or <span class="highlight">ONI</span> for short, which you can read more about <a href="#">here</a>. So why does ONAA need to rely on ONI to adjust a food's Health Score?
  		</p>

      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Basically, For every item in ONI's <span class="highlight">Unhealthy Index</span> list that is also found in a food's nutritional data, a point is subtracted from that food's overall Health Score. Since ONI's unhealthy index list has only 30 items in it, a food could only lose a maximum of 30 points in this stage. If a food did in fact lose 30 points in this layer it would have a Health Score of 70

      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 2:</span> Watch Those Calories Baby:</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Next we have to consider the amount of calories (measured in kcals) for every 100 grams of a given food. <span class="highlight">(100 grams is what ONAA deems as one serving of any given food)</span>. ONAA's role here is simple, it takes the daily recommended caloric intake for most people worldwide across all ages, <span class="highlight">2500 kcals</span>, and divides number that by our food's total kcals per serving. The result of this equation will tell ONAA how many servings of that food you can eat until reaching the recommended daily calorie intake. Since you should only eat roughly 2500 calories per day, what we are left with is a numeric spectrum that goes from 1 to 2500. A 1 on that spectrum means you can only eat one serving of that food before you reach your daily calorie intake limit while a 500 means you can eat 500 servings of that food before reaching your limit. The whole idea here is that the more of something you can eat without exceeding your recommended caloric intake, the healthier it is for you! So how does this affect the overall Health Score for a given food?
  		</p>
			<br />
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Well wherever a food may land on that spectrum, we take that number, divide it by 100, and that becomes the total number of points we add to the overall Health Score. The maximum number of points a food can gain here is 25. If a food has 0 calories, Onna gives it 25 points right off the gate.

    <div class="how-it-works-section">
      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 3:</span> Remember Jump Rope for Heart?</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        According to the American Heart Association:
        <span class="highlight">"You should limit the amount of trans-fats to less than 1 percent of your total daily calories. That means if you need about 2,000 calories a day, less than 20 calories (or 2 grams) should come from trans fats"</span>. For our purposes ONAA will use 2500 calories a day which means the maximum recommended limit for trans-fats is 2.5 grams a day! And since ONAA considers a single serving for any given food to be 100 grams, it will take the amount of calories (kcals) for every 100 grams of that food, divide 2500 by that number, take the result and multiply it by the trans-fat amount found in one serving of that food. If the product of this multiplication exceeds the daily recommended limit (2.5 grams) then we will subtract 15 points from the total score. If it doesn't then nothing will happen to the total score. While it may be true that some of your calories should come from trans-fats, even just occasionally exceeding your daily limit can greatly affect you health in the long run.

      <h2 class="how-it-works-subheader"><span class="highlight">Layer 5:</span> ONNA's Hierarchy of Food Needs</h2>
      <p class="how-it-works-copy">
        Remember that silly food group pyramid we used to study in elementary school? Well as it turns out, it's not as useless as we all thought! ONNA's fifth and final layer is regarded as the least informative layer in terms of evaluating how healthy a given food is to consume. As such, this layer affects the overall Health Score the least and accounts for only 15 points of the maximum 100 Health Score points a food can receive. Currently the United States Department of Agriculture recognizes 25 distinct food groups. While most of these food groups don't really indicate how healthy any of the foods that fall under it are, there are a few groups that we can confidently identify as mostly unhealthy. Those groups, as recognized by the United States Department of Agriculture, are the "Fast Foods" group and "Sweets" group.
  		</p>
			<p class="how-it-works-copy">
      	Because of this, if ONNA finds that a given food is categorized as "Fast Foods" or "Sweets", it will automatically subtract 15 points from that food's final Health Score.
