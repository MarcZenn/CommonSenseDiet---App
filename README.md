# CommonSenseDiet- A Simple Web-App 
Version 1.0 12/17/2015



# What Is It?

The CommonSenseDiet website is a simple way to know if a certain food or 
dish is either GOOD for you in terms of nutrients....
or BAD for you in terms of adding girth to your waistline. Nothing more. 
Simply look up your foods/meals and get a YES or NO response. 
While the developers of this project want to keep this simple, we are 
eager to maintin a robust, collaborative, open-source code base.
